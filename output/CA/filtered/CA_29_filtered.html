<td>Note 1: A product of this Chapter is an originating product if it is the result of any one of the following: (a) an applicable change in tariff classification specified in the rules of origin of this Chapter ; (b) a chemical reaction as described in Note 2 below; or (c) purification as described in Note 3 below.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Note 2: Chemical reaction and change of Chemical Abstract Service number A product of this Chaptershall be treated as an originating product if it is the result of a chemical reaction and that chemical reaction results in a change of Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) number. For the purposes of this Chapter , a 'chemical reaction' is a process (including a biochemical process) that results in a molecule with a new structure by breaking intramolecular bonds and by forming new intramolecular bonds or by altering the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule. The following are not considered to be chemical reactions for the purposes of determining whether a product is originating: (a) dissolution in water or in another solvent; (b) the elimination of solvents, including solvent water; or (c) the addition or elimination of water of crystallization.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Note 3: Purification A product of this Chapter that is subject to purification shall be treated as an originating product provided that the purification occurs in the territory of one or both of the Parties and results in the elimination of not less than 80 per cent of the impurities.</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>Note 4: Separation prohibition A product that meets the applicable change in tariff classification in the territory of one or both of the Parties as a result of the separation of one or more materials from a man-made mixture shall not be treated as an originating product unless the isolated material underwent a chemical reaction in the territory or one or both of the Parties.</td></tr>
